# How to run
1. Snakemake to align Fastqs with cellranger --> count matrices (you can skip this step if you downloaded the count matrices directly)
2. Run through `notebooks/Prepare_Data.ipynb` using jupyter notebook. (you can also skip this step if you aquired the file `exp2_lung_tcells.h5`)
3. Produce the figures in the paper with `notebooks/Produce_Figures_4IJK_S15.ipynb` using jupyter notebook.
